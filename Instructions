Step 1: The user should use the url "localhost:8000/getRecent to retrieve the 10 most recent users

Step 2: The user should login using the URL, "localhost:8000/login" with the credentials 
	username: admin
	password: admin

Step 3: After logging in, the user can retrieve the users with the most number of followers and the users who made the latest comments

I have made a new users table for logging in users and rename the current users table to users_new
